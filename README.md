### Boilerpipe Client

This is a small Erlang OTP application which connects to the boilerpipe_node

### License
All code in this library comes under the P2P Production License 
http://p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License

Essentially, you can use it for fun or to learn, or as part of an open source library / system for free, 
but a commerical enterprise should request the ability to use, change or update the code for their commercial purpose. 
This may incur a fee. Please contact us through github to discuss your requirements

### Rationale

We have the node made (see https://github.com/Radardisc/boilerpipe_node )
Now we want to connect to it from our erlang nodes
